# The-Meditations
I hope that when I look back at this repo upon my graduation, I will feel that my time hasn't been wasted.

Should the research model of robots follow human behavior? Is language actually an essential input component for robots? And what truly constitutes a robot's ability to solve complex tasks?
Someone took their dog on a trip to the remote countryside, but the dog got lost halfway—surprisingly, it found its way back home by itself later. Yet what kind of ability does this dog’s "wayfinding" actually demonstrate?
If I were forced to decouple and replicate this kind of "old horse knowing the way" - like ability of the dog onto a robot, by analogy with existing technologies, I might consider it a form of VXA. Here, the "X" is not "L" (Language), but input from other modalities, such as scent or something else.
