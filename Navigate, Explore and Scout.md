Exploration and scouting are essentially about obtaining information through actions and reducing uncertainty. I am not a linguist, so I find it difficult to analyze the differences between these two words from a linguistic perspective of definitions. I am more accustomed to using specific examples—especially content related to robots or games—to explain them.
