Exploration and scouting are essentially about obtaining information through actions and reducing uncertainty. I am not a linguist, so I find it difficult to analyze the differences between these two words from a linguistic perspective of definitions. I am more accustomed to using specific examples—especially content related to robots or games—to explain them.

Typically, the core mission of a robotic vacuum cleaner is to clean all accessible areas of a space. 

First Use (Map Establishment Phase): A robotic vacuum cleaner lacks prior knowledge of the room’s layout—such as the positions of walls, furniture, or obstacles—during its initial operation. It navigates the space to "learn" its surroundings, construct a spatial map, and demarcate accessible regions. This constitutes a classic example of exploratory behavior: its primary objective is to comprehensively cover and comprehend the unfamiliar environment, rather than engaging in "scouting for specific information." For instance, it does not prioritize locating "a particular stain" as its first task; instead, its focus is directed toward the entire space.

Subsequent Uses (Routine Cleaning Phase): Even when equipped with a pre-constructed map, the robotic vacuum still requires verifying whether the environment has undergone changes (e.g., a newly placed chair blocking its path) and ensuring no areas are overlooked. In essence, this remains an exploratory process: its core focus persists on full spatial coverage, rather than "targeted reconnaissance of a specific point."

Before the invention of large language models (LLMs) or vision-language models (VLMs), if I were to design a robotic vacuum cleaner to execute commands such as "help me clean the kitchen" or "help me clean the bathroom," I would typically first need to perform SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) on the entire room. After that, I would have to manually label or delineate the boundaries of the bathroom, and then confine the robot’s operational design domain (ODD) to that specific area. This process required a significant amount of manual auxiliary work—because for robotic vacuums at that time, in normal mode, they were merely machines capable of obstacle avoidance and reaching mapped locations; they could not understand so-called advanced or abstract commands.
